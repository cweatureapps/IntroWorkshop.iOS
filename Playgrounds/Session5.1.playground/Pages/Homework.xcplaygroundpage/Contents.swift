 ## Homework - Transactions model
 
 The parsing of the transactions from JSON and the scaffolding is already implemented.
 Unit tests are already implemented too.
 Take a TDD approach and make the unit tests pass, and also address any **FIXME** in the project.
 
 * In the `Transaction` struct, you'll get some hand-on practice with date parsing and formatting. You can also simply the implementation of `transactionList(json:)` by using `flatMap`.
 * In the `Account` class, apply functional programming techniques to simplify `accountList(json:)`
 * In the file `AccountsManager+Transactions.swift`, try to apply functional programming techniques to implement the sorting/grouping logic for the `groupedTransactions(for:)` method.
