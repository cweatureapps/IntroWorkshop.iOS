### Homework Exercises

Open up the project **IntroWorkshop.xcodeproj** and implement the following. 
It is recommended that you follow a TDD approach.

1. Create an `Account` model object that represents one of the account objects from `GetAccounts.json`.
2. Write a method `getMaskedAccountNumber` that returns a `String` of the account number masked. E.g. "1234 5678 9012 3456" becomes "XXXX XXXX XXXX 3456".
3. Convert the method into a readonly property `maskedAccountNumber` instead.
4. Create an initializer that takes the JSON dictionary `[String: AnyObject]` and parses it into a single `Account` model object.
5. Write a type method `accountListFromJSON` that parses the JSON dictionary `[String: AnyObject]` and returns the array `[Account]`.


Note: For this exercise, there is no need to read the JSON file. In your unit tests, just supply your test data directly as a dictionary.
